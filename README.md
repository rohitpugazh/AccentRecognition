# 🧠 AccentRecognition — Wav2Vec2-Based Accent Classifier

This project fine-tunes [facebook/wav2vec2-base](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base) for **English accent classification** using 167K+ audio clips. It supports `.mp3` and `.wav` inputs and provides a simple web interface built with Flask.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- 🎤 Predicts 11 English accents from audio clips  
- 🧠 Built using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch  
- ⚡ Inference-ready: supports real-time MP3/WAV uploads  
- 🌐 Web-based interface for quick testing

## 🧠 Model & Dataset

- **Model**: `facebook/wav2vec2-base`, fine-tuned for multi-class classification
- **Accents**:  
  American, British, Australian, South Asian, German, Filipino, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Canadian, Scottish, Southern African
- **Input**: Raw 16kHz waveform (MP3s auto-converted on-the-fly)

### 📂 Dataset

Trained on the [**Common Voice 20.0**](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) corpus by Mozilla.  
- Language: English (`cv-corpus-20.0-2024-12-06/en/`)
- Only a subset of samples with valid `accent` metadata were used
- Files were standardized and resampled to 16kHz for model compatibility
